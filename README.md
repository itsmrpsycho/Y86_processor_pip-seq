# Y86 Processor - Sequential and Pipelined architectures

## Sannidhya Gupta & Krishna Singh

## The objective of this project is to develop a processor architecture design based on the Y86-64 ISA using Verilog. The processor should be able to execute all instructions in the Y86-64 ISA. Modular approach is to be followed. The goal is to produce a 5 stage pipelined Y86-64 implementation.
